class AutoShips:
    """
    Randomly create all player's ships on a grid
    ----------
    Attributes:
        offset (int): Where the grid starts (in number of blocks)
                (typically 0 for computer and 15 for human)
        available_blocks (set of tuples): coordinates of all blocks
                that are available for creating ships (updated every time a ship is created)
        ships_set (set of tuples): all blocks that are occupied by ships
        ships (list of lists): list of all individual ships (as lists)
    ----------
    Methods:
        __create_start_block(available_blocks):
            Randomly chooses a block from which to start creating a ship.
            Randomly chooses horizontal or vertical type of a ship
            Randomly chooses direction (from the start block) - straight or reverse
            Returns three randomly chosen values
        __create_ship(number_of_blocks, available_blocks):
            Creates a ship of given length (number_of_blocks) starting from the start block
                returned by the previous method, using type of ship and direction (changing it
                if going outside of grid) returned by previous method.
                Checks if the ship is valid (not adjacent to other ships and within the grid)
                and adds it to the list of ships.
            Returns: a list of tuples with a new ship's coordinates
        __get_new_block_for_ship(self, coor, direction, orientation, ship_coordinates):
            Checks if new individual blocks that are being added to a ship in the previous method
                are within the grid, otherwise changes the direction.
            Returns:
                direction (int): straight or reverse
                incremented/decremented coordinate of the last/first block in a ship under construction
        __is_ship_valid(new_ship):
            Check if all of a ship's coordinates are within the available blocks set.
            Returns: True or False
        __add_new_ship_to_set(new_ship):
            Adds all blocks in a ship's list to the ships_set
        __update_available_blocks_for_creating_ships(new_ship):
            Removes all blocks occupied by a ship and around it from the available blocks set
        __populate_grid():
            Creates needed number of each type of ships by calling the create_ship method.
                Adds every ship to the ships list, ships_set and updates the available blocks.
            Returns: the list of all ships
